2021-03-12 11:10:00.337407: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:142] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX AVX2
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
2021-03-12 11:10:00.388870: W tensorflow/python/util/util.cc:348] Sets are not currently considered sequences, but this may change in the future, so consider avoiding using them.
Some weights of the PyTorch model were not used when initializing the TF 2.0 model TFGPT2LMHeadModel: ['transformer.h.1.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.13.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.14.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.18.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.10.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.15.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.6.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.12.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.22.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.7.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.23.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.0.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.11.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.20.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.5.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.19.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.16.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.8.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.21.attn.masked_bias', 'lm_head.weight', 'transformer.h.17.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.3.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.4.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.2.attn.masked_bias', 'transformer.h.9.attn.masked_bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFGPT2LMHeadModel from a PyTorch model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a TFBertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFGPT2LMHeadModel from a PyTorch model that you expect to be exactly identical (e.g. initializing a TFBertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
All the weights of TFGPT2LMHeadModel were initialized from the PyTorch model.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFGPT2LMHeadModel for predictions without further training.
